# Block 24: Intro to React - Guided Practice

React is an open-source JavaScript library for front-end development. Using React via a content delivery network, or CDN, is not necessarily a best practice. But, doing so offers a terrific way to start finding out how React integrates with what we have already learned. So, let us explore how React via a CDN can interface with a simple HTML document.

## Get Started

1. In a location of your choice, create an index.html file.
2. Select the following link, which comes from the React documentation: [React With CDN](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gaearon/0275b1e1518599bbeafcde4722e79ed1/raw/db72dcbf3384ee1708c4a07d3be79860db04bff0/example.html)
3. Copy that code, and then paste it into your index.html file.
4. Open your HTML document either by using Live Server or in any other way. "Hello World!" displays on the screen.

1. Write a component named `Profile`. In the component, include at least your name, picture, and email address. Make sure it exists in the same scope as the `<MyApp /> `component.
2. Render your `Profile` component
